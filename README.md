# ANN-Classification-Churn-Prediction
🚀 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN – End-to-End Project Deployment!

Excited to share a hands-on project I completed as part of Krish Naik’s Udemy course on Deep Learning, where I built a bank customer churn prediction model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch.

🔍 Project Highlights:
✅ Preprocessed the dataset by applying encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical features
✅ Built a Sequential ANN model using Keras with dense layers and activation functions
✅ Evaluated model performance using classification metrics
✅ Created an interactive Streamlit web app to allow users to input customer data and get real-time predictions
✅ Deployed the app for easy access and demonstration

📈 This project gave me a strong understanding of building, tuning, and deploying deep learning models in a real-world business scenario.

A big thanks to Krish Naik for the detailed and practical guidance in his course!
